Copy anything that you need to paste frequently to clipboard by using this program.

To make this work you will need to create a file named copymy_config.toml in your user's home directory e.g. for me my home directory on OSX is /Users/hithacker. It might be something different for you depending on your username and the operating system you are using.

Add the things you often need to copy in this file in key value format. For example I need to copy my linkedin and github urls often so I will put them into this file like below:

linkedin="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hirenthacker"

github="https://github.com/hithacker"

Let me know if you have any questions by mailing me on hithacker@gmail.com or by raising an issue.
