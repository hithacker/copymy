Copy anything that you need to paste frequently to clipboard by using this program. For example when applying for jobs you often need to enter your linkedin url or github url and you may not always remember it so you have to waste time looking for it in your browser history or even worse you need to open the linkedin website and copy the url.

##Configuration
To make this work you will need to create a file named copymy_config.toml in your user's home directory e.g. for me my home directory on OSX is /Users/hithacker. It might be something different for you depending on your username and the operating system you are using. Add the things you often need to copy in this file in key value format. You can take a look at my config file as an example https://github.com/hithacker/copymy/blob/master/copymy_config.toml

##Usage
Just type the command name followed by the name of the thing you want to copy
    
    $ copymy linkedin
    Copied https://www.linkedin.com/in/hirenthacker to keyboard
    $ copymy github
    Copied https://github.com/hithacker to keyboard
